title: Reporting Events
---
As a community tool, we trust the community to use it appropriately. However, all operations of this tool are automated to expedite communication and this makes the tool vulnerable to spam or predatory events. We request that the events added are community policed :oncoming_police_car:. In that, if anything is seen to be wrong/ duplicated/ offensive/ inappropriate, we expect the community to report the event :pencil2: (using the [report link](http://bit.ly/reportorc) in our Twitter bio).  

Please note that the admins volunteer their time for this tool and as such, the response time may be delayed. :clock2:
