Data Management Plans (DMPs) are often required by research funders and writing them has become an important skill for researchers. A DMP is also a useful tool that helps you plan your research data management, assess and avoid risks, and coordinate with your collaborators. In this online workshop we will go through some of the topics that are common to many DMP templates, such as:

- Where your data should be stored, how it can be shared with collaborators during your project
- Some steps that help you make your data FAIR (Findable-Accessible-Interoperable-Reusable)
- Open access to research data, publishing in data repositories
- Legal and ethical dimensions of your research data: protecting personal, sensitive, confidential data

You will be encouraged to consider the topics from the point of view of your own project or bring your own DMP if you have already started. Resources for getting further training and help will also be discussed.

Who can participate?

This online event is mainly intended for Aalto researchers and doctoral students, but everyone who is interested in the topic can participate. Some of the examples (e.g., data storage solutions) covered in the session are mainly relevant to those working or studying at Aalto. There are no prerequisites, although this workshop is suitable as a follow-up to the Introduction to RDM webinar. Participants who want to prepare their questions in advance can study the previous recording of our DMP training (30-minute lecture, worksheet). The event is free of charge.

Learning outcomes

You will learn about the topics usually covered in DMPs and have practical tips for writing them. You will learn how DMPs can help you plan your research data management over the course of your project’s life cycle. You will also learn about additional resources to further aid you in planning your research data management in more detail.

Format

A 1.5 hour online workshop with presentation of the DMP sections and discussion of each section. The session will not be recorded. Participants will receive a worksheet including links to further resources.

FAIR is the first part of data management, but what comes next? To get the most value of our research data, our data should be alive, which means that the research community can contribute back with improvements. That means that we can accept contributions from others easily, and others can use and modify the data without making diverging copies. Thus, this talk proposes a “C” (for “collaborative contributions”) beyond the normal FAIR acronym.

After some thought, in our view the best solution to achieving the above is GitHub, which has a tagline of “Social Coding”. What if it wasn’t limited to “coding”?

While GitHub is normally used for software or computational work, it has the potential to solve other needs of RDM: version history, attribution for each change, and, most importantly, a way for anyone to make and comment on change proposals without needing to ask for special permission first (and use their own versions, without making it impossible to merge versions again later on). Could GitHub be used also in non-computational research, in order to improve the FAIRness of academic projects in general?

This event will

Introduce the background to the above and why GitHub could be appropriate for different kinds of non-code academic projects
Introduce an example of using GitHub for a non-code academic project
See how GitHub can allow an outside person to easily contribute to a non-code project.
Discuss how and what barriers there would be to adopting GitHub more broadly (e.g. is there a user interface that is simple and usable enough for broad use?)
Include discussion and future planning (e.g. does anyone want to begin setting something up?)

Who can participate?

The webinar is aimed at university staff and students who are interested in the topic. No prior knowledge of RDM is required. Some information covered in the session, such as details of Aalto’s RDM services, is relevant only to those working at Aalto. The webinar is free of charge.

Format
